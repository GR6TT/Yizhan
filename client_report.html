            <h2>Client Report</h2>
            <p><strong>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</strong><br>
            I selected content that matched the core theme of the site and my personal positioning, and the client also provided the images I needed to use.</p>

            <p><strong>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</strong><br>
            I communicated with the developer during class and via emails. There were minor misunderstandings on individual details in the process, which were resolved through timely supplementary communication.</p>

            <p><strong>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</strong><br>
            Generally, the developer met my basic expectations for the site’s functions and style, and also added some small optimizations that improved the user experience.</p>

            <p><strong>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</strong><br>
            Next time, I will sort out more detailed requirement standards in advance to reduce the need for later revisions and make the cooperation more efficient.</p>

            <!-- Lead Developer角色报告 -->
            <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
            <p><strong>How did you manage your development team and communicate the tasks for your junior devs?</strong><br>
            I communicated with the team during class, sent emails for formal notifications, and collaborated with junior developers through GitHub to assign and track tasks.</p>

            <p><strong>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?</strong><br>
            I kept in touch with the client through in-class communication and emails. Occasionally, there were delays in requirement confirmation and minor misunderstandings on individual details.</p>

            <p><strong>How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?</strong><br>
            I published the client’s site via GitHub and shared the access link and related information with the client through emails.</p>

            <p><strong>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</strong><br>
            Using GitHub for site management was generally smooth, and the version control function helped avoid confusion in code updates, with only a short learning curve for permission settings.</p>

            <!-- Junior Developer角色报告 -->
            <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
            <p><strong>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?</strong><br>
            I followed the team’s communication rules to report progress to the lead. There were minor ambiguities in individual task requirements, which were clarified through one-on-one communication.</p>

            <p><strong>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</strong><br>
            The team lead provided clear task guidelines, so I had a clear understanding of the functional and style requirements for each page I was responsible for.</p>

            <p><strong>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</strong><br>
            I completed the core content of the assigned pages as required, and also put forward some small optimization suggestions that were adopted by the team.</p>

            <p><strong>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</strong><br>
            I encountered small problems with code merging at first, but with the lead’s guidance, I quickly mastered the process and did not have similar issues later.</p>

            <!-- General Experience and Reflections -->
            <h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>
            <p><strong>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</strong><br>
            The biggest challenge was multi-task collaboration as a client, a team member and a team leader. I successfully overcame it and gained a lot from the experience.</p>

            <p><strong>What did you enjoy most about this project?</strong><br>
            I enjoyed the process of team collaboration the most, and the sense of accomplishment from seeing the final site go live was very rewarding.</p>

            <p><strong>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</strong><br>
            If I could redo it, I would start the preparation work earlier and reserve more buffer time for unexpected situations to make the process more relaxed.</p>

            <p><strong>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</strong><br>
            Yes, this experience improved my practical operation and communication abilities, and made me more confident in dealing with similar projects in the future.</p>
